<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Sente Assistant is an add-on application for browsing and searching the notes that you take in Sente.</p>

<p>It extends the functionality of Sente, and provides a view on your library, enabling you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse your Sente notes, sorted by their correct position on the source page</li>
<li>Perform keyword, wildcard, or tag searches of your notes</li>
<li>Add XHTML annotations to your references</li>
<li>Search the references you select in Sente, or across all notes/annotations in your Library</li>
<li>Generate an index of all tagged notes</li>
<li>Identify duplicate references in your library</li>
<li>Save your filtered notes or search results in a single RTF, HTML, PDF, ODT, DOC, DOCX, or TXT file</li>
<li>Customize the presentation of your notes in the Assistant
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p><i>Sente Assistant is a free, third-party application, not a supported product. It is offered "as is" at no
cost, for non-commercial use only. It is my hope that it may be useful for your research. The Assistant is 
designed to only read your Sente Library. It includes nothing that modifies or changes the content of your library,
and should be completely safe. Nevertheless, I offer no warranty or guarantee of the fitness of this application.
I have tested the Assistant with Sente 6.6.5 on OS X 10.9.2, with recent versions of Safari and Firefox. It should 
work under other configurations (e.g. Chrome), but I haven't tried them.</i></p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>I was inspired to create this after I tried Dana Leighton's nifty script for exporting Sente notes. Originally,
I wanted a way to filter and export my notes into a single file, but I couldn't see how to do this simply with 
AppleScript (I'm sure it's possible, but I didn't have the time to learn AppleScript). I also wanted a solution
to a number of the issues with the presentation of notes in Sente (e.g., ordering and font size). So, I decided 
to create a small add-on application using a language that I know: VisualWorks Smalltalk.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The Assistant is designed for ease of use. It runs as a separate stand-alone application. Rather 
than presenting a desktop window, it runs through a web browser. That is, you simply point your web browser 
at a local address, and the Assistant operates there. You do not need an Internet connection for this.</p>

<p>To install the Assistant, unzip the file and place the entire <span class="cmd">Sente Assistant</span> folder 
inside your <span class="cmd">Applications</span> folder. All the pieces needed by the Assistant are contained 
within this one folder.</p>

<p>To launch, simply double-click on <span class="cmd">Sente Assistant</span>. Then, point your web browser
at: <span class="cmd">http://localhost:8008/</span>. This is a local port used only by the Assistant.</p>

<p>At runtime, the Assistant communicates with the Sente application to locate your Library. It will use the Library
you currently have open in Sente. For this, Sente needs to be running, and this is the expected way to use the
Assistant. That is, with Sente open, you launch the Assistant. If, however, you launch the Assistant first,
it will in turn launch Sente to communicate about your current Library.</p>

<p>To quit the Assistant, use the <span class="cmd">Quit</span> command through its web interface. Any changes 
you make on the <span class="cmd">Preferences</span> page will be saved to disk, and restored for your next session. 
Note that the <span class="cmd">Quit</span> menu command for the application icon that appears in the dock will not 
have any effect, as the Assistant is running in the background as a server application.</p>

<h2>Browsing and Searching Notes</h2>
<p>When you open the Assistant, it will display the references that are currently selected in Sente.
These should appear in the right-hand side of the Assistant window. For each reference, it will display 
the associated notes.</p>

<p>By default, these notes are sorted by page number, as in Sente, but they are further ordered by their vertical 
position on each page. This corrects for the problem in Sente that notes do not follow the expected order in which 
they appear on each PDF page. The Assistant can handle single or multiple columns of text, and even some more 
complex page layouts that combine both.</p>

<p>By selecting options from the <span class="cmd">View</span> menu, you can choose various ways to present the notes.
For example, <span class="cmd">Notes and Summary</span> displays a summary list of all the note titles at the top,
each of these headings is a hyperlink to the associated note. Each <span class="cmd">View</span> option corresponds 
to a template file. You can edit these templates to modify the presentation, or add new ones.</p>

<h2>Filtering Notes</h2>
<p>You can also filter the notes for currently-selected references by choosing the <span class="cmd">Filter</span> 
option on the <span class="cmd">Notes</span> dropdown menu, and then entering filter strings. In this way, you can search 
any part of the notes, or focus on the titles, quotations, or comments. If you enter more than one filter, a logical AND will be 
performed for titles, quotations, comments, and only the notes that contain the specified filter string(s) will be displayed. 
If you enter a filter in the <span class="cmd">Any</span> field, it will ignore the others and perform a logical OR match 
for this string against all the note fields. These filtering operations are case-insensitive. Wildcards are possible using the 
<span class="cmd">%</span> character.</p>

<p>If you select <span class="cmd">Filter Notes: By Color</span> on the <span class="cmd">Preferences</span> page, 
a color palette appears on the sidebar. Use this to filter notes by their color. To enable or disable a particular color filter, 
simply click on it.</p>

<p>Each time you change one of the filtering options, the Assistant will query the Sente Library and refresh the
notes display. You can also refresh the notes display at any time by clicking on <span class="cmd">Assistant</span> 
at the top left.</p>

<h2>Searching your Reference Library</h2>
<p>By default, the Assistant will only display the references you have seleced in Sente. It is also possible to expand your 
search from the currently-selected references to all references in your entire Library. For this, select <span class="cmd">All References</span> 
from the <span class="cmd">References</span> drop-down menu. Other options in this menu enable you to filter references
for strings in the title, author names, or annotations on your references (annotations are explained below). Using these options, your note filtering options can be applied to either a larger or more specific set of references. This may be useful for locating all 
notes on a particular author or concept.</p>

<h2>Working with Tagged Notes</h2>
<p>Using the filters, you can find all notes that have been marked with a specific tag (e.g. <span class="cmd">#history</span>) 
in the note's comment field. That is, you can enter the tags as free-form text in the note comment. Wildcard searching of tagged 
notes is also possible, e.g., a search for <span class="cmd">#%history</span> would find <span class="cmd">#americanHistory</span>.</p>

<p>To view an index of all the tags used by the currently-selected references, select <span class="cmd">Tag Index</span>
on the <span class="cmd">View</span> drop-down menu. You can also view an index of all the tags you have used in the entire library by selecting the <span class="cmd">All References</span> filtering option.</p>

<p>By default, the tag format uses a hash mark (e.g., <span class="cmd">#history</span>), but you can specify your own 
custom format from the <span class="cmd">Preferences</span> page. The format specified on this page is used to generate 
the tag index. If you use the hash mark or another single character, your tags cannot include spaces; however, if you use curly 
brackets or some other characters at the beginning and ending of the tag pattern (e.g., <span class="cmd">{my tag}</span>), 
your tags can be short phrases that include spaces, hyphens, or other non-alphanumeric characters. For the tag delimiters, only non-alphanumeric characters are recognized for tags, with the exception of a few reserved characters used by the SQLite 
database (e.g., single quote, underscrore, percent sign, and ampersand) which are not recognized.</p>

<h2>Finding Duplicate References</h2>
<p>Use the <span class="cmd">View</span> option <span class="cmd">Duplicate References</span> to see all references 
with identical titles. (This option ignores all of the note filtering settings.) Each duplicate is accompanied by a Sente link. 
You can click on these light blue links to switch focus to Sente and select the duplicate reference. Although it is best to 
double-check the duplicate items first, you can easily hit <span class="cmd">Command+Delete</span> in Sente to remove 
a duplicate reference from your Library.</p>

<h2>Annotations</h2>
<p>Use the <span class="cmd">View</span> option <span class="cmd">Annotations</span> to view and edit annotations
on your references. Annotations are like tagged metadata, but they associate free-form XHTML with each Sente reference. 
In this fashion, you can annotate your references with formatted text, ordered and unordered lists, hyperlinks, etc. For example,
when viewing a reference to a book in the <span class="cmd">Annotations</span> view, click <span class="cmd">Edit</span>
followed by <span class="cmd">Add</span> to create a new annotation. You can then select and edit the name and content of the annotation using the built-in text editor. When finished, click <span class="cmd">Done</span> to save your changes.</p>

<p>The Assistant can filter your references to find strings in your annotations. For example, to find all references that include 
the string "american history" in an annotation, select <span class="cmd">Filter All</span> on the <span class="cmd">References</span> drop-down menu, and enter "american history" in the <span class="cmd">Annotation</span> field.</p>

<p>Annotations are associated with Sente References, but they are held in a separate database. In keeping with the design 
of Sente Assistant, your library is never modified. For this reason, an annotation is associated with a specific reference in a 
specific library. If you move the reference to another library, the annotation will not be duplicated. They are stored in the file 
~/Documents/Sente Assistant Annotations.sqlite.</p>

<p>Annotations can also be used to hold metadata such as a summary or table of contents. The Assistant knows how to 
fetch this information from the WorldCat database (at present, for books only). For this, click <span class="cmd">Get Metadata</span>. The <span class="cmd">Annotations</span> view also includes a <span class="cmd">Get all Metadata</span> link in the upper-right corner of the view. Clicking on this enables you to fetch metadata in bulk from WorldCat, for all references in the Assistant's view. Note that if you fetch metadata and then edit it, fetching it again will overwrite your changes.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Sente includes a built-in web browser, and it was originally my intention to run the Sente Assistant in one tab of this
browser. Behind the scenes, the Assistant uses AppleScript to communicate with Sente and query for details about the
library and current selections. The Sente scripting interface includes a way to explicitly specify the library, but it does not
seem to work. Even if the library is specified, Sente only responds with meaningful data when the library is the active tab. 
Thus, it is not currently possible to run the Assistant as a tab inside Sente. If the Sente developers remove this restriction 
in a future release of the product (and I hope they will consider this), the Assistant could be used inside Sente, as 
originally intended.</p>

<h2>Customizing</h2>
<p>While the Sente Assistant has been written using the Smalltalk language, much of the application is implemented 
using server pages, JavaScript, and CSS. You can customize both the appearance and function of the application by 
editing the various files in the <span class="cmd">/templates</span> directory. Styles and layouts are defined in the
file <span class="cmd">template.css</span>, while the various views are generated by JSP-style server pages in the 
<span class="cmd">template*.ssp</span> files. You can add new template files and the Assistant will find them when
you refresh. As always, you should make a back-up before you attempt any changes. Each time you modify a page, 
it may be necessary to restart the Assistant for it to take effect. As necessary, I can provide more details about the 
internals of the application. </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
